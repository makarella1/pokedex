<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<b>Super excited to finish this project. Gained plenty of experience with TypeScript, but still have a lot to learn and also get used to navigate through 
TypeScript code in a React project. I've come to some conclusions as well:
<ul>
<li>Using Tailwind's @apply with CSS modules isn't as great as I thought, so I'll think of learning some new styling technology (stitches + radix?).
Anyways, Tailwind is a great tool and I'll use it in my further project despite the fact that these huge classnames will look awful without @apply and
CSS modules, in addition components will be kind of cluttered but Tailwind is worth it so as learning some new styling technologies :)
</li>
<li>I'm a little tired of this Firebase's magic with auth and storage so it leads me to think that I need to deeply dive into Node.js, some database
and other backend techologies to implement all the features that I need with my own hands without third-party libraries like Firebase. Learning backend
is a good idea in general, it'll come in handy in practicing TypeScript and gaining experience from the other side from web development. Also it'll help
me to get my hands dirty with fullstack development which in turn will help me with building fullstack web3 apps and blockchains (in which I'm really interested),
but I still have a lot to learn and won't rush things with web3 and blockchain
</li>
</ul>
That's pretty much it. I'm going to take a little brake and learn some new techs to return with some amazing project. Stay tuned! Now I should stop talking
